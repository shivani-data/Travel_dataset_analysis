# 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis: Indian Travel Dataset
Welcome to this SQL-powered Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project based on the Indian Travel Dataset. This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to clean, explore, and draw insights from real-world tabular data using foundational to intermediate SQL queries.

## 🗺️ Dataset Overview
Title: Travel Dataset: Guide to India's Must See Places

Source: Kaggle (<alt="Link"/>)(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saketk511/travel-dataset-guide-to-indias-must-see-places)

Contents: Information about Indian tourist destinations, including state, region, type (e.g., adventure, spiritual), estimated ideal duration, ratings, and more.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
Perform data cleaning and structure standardization using SQL

Conduct exploratory queries to understand travel trends and preferences

Generate insights based on type, popularity, and geographical distribution

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL (MySQL syntax)

Jupyter Notebook

Python (for SQL execution )

Pandas (for result presentation)

## 📌 Key SQL Tasks Performed
Task	SQL Concepts Used
Inspect schema ->	SELECT *, LIMIT
Clean null values & duplicates	WHERE, IS NULL, DISTINCT
Analyze travel types and categories	GROUP BY, COUNT(), ORDER BY
Destination popularity ranking	ORDER BY, LIMIT
Compare states by destination count	GROUP BY, COUNT()
Filter top-rated spiritual and adventure spots	WHERE, AND, OR

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
Translating business/travel questions into SQL queries

Structuring and cleaning real-world datasets

Applying aggregate functions to generate insights

Presenting findings in a notebook format for clarity

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project is a solid example of how SQL can be used to analyze and summarize data outside of a business context — in this case, for planning travel. It also highlights how basic SQL operations can lead to meaningful insights with clean data and the right questions.
